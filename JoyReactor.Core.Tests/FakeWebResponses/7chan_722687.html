Dream thread. Post any dreams that you remember. Pic related: my bed.
<br/>
<br/>I was looking at a CD album art that looked like a gray arch and some clouds, or maybe a girl&#039;s butt, but probably a grey stone arch and some grey clouds. Señora S., my Spanish teacher, was explaining to us about the artist, and I looked forward and saw a larger image of the painting. There was a tornado in the ocean, and I asked if God was angry. Señora S. said no, it was only a demon. The tornado turned into a storm that generated some orange light. It plunged down into the water and then exploded, and out of it came an aircraft. This aircraft was similar to the Halberd (Kirby, video game) in shape, but mostly it resembled what I imagined Howl&#039;s castle (Howl&#039;s Moving Castle, movie) to look like when it was first created. It was a great airship with many wings and Howl was there shouting about how great it was to be flying in the airship, and I was there with him. He said to someone who I now assume to be Calcifer that he should have brought another blanket. We were flying low over great mountains now, and then we were upon them, sliding along the ridge, being pulled by a rope. The ridge was sharp. There was no flat area on the ridge, only an edge where the two sides of the mountain came together. We continued along for some time, slowing down and climbing a bit more upward now. I was holding on to the rope, and pulling myself up, and I realized that I was the last in the band of climbers who perhaps resembled the band of dwarfs in The Hobbit, and so I ran. We came to what seemed to be the top of the mountain, because there were bushes and a stone path. We went up this stone path, amid some apprehensions. I was still the last in line, along with some other person, and we heard someone say &quot;Get out of here!&quot; and so I ran the other way. I soon decided that I should not abandon my company, and I went back up the stone path, grabbing onto the bushes to pull me along because it is hard to run in a dream, and there were some of our men and some soldiers with brown stone blocks as part of their heads or their hats, I&#039;m not sure. We were lined up along what looked like a runway for a plane, and there might have been a castle in the background, but I was not paying attention to that. It was like a turn-based RPG. I did a combo attack with my spear, and woke up.<br/>

I actually started doing this before but ended up giving up on logging each dream so I had more time before work. Anyways, I have this one... I didn&#039;t go in to much detail about what specifically happened because I was having trouble sleeping and kept waking up and falling back to sleep, forgetting little details each time. Anyways, this was the general idea:
<br/>&quot;I dreamt that I was able to achieve temporary happiness by living as someone else, but the scenario always ended up a complete failure. I&#039;d live as them temporarily, it started out as me being some guy who seemed rich and important staying at what looked like a large building similar to the inside of a mansion in the middle of some classy party. When I went outside it was actually in the downtown streets of a large city, like New York or something. There were always several options I could take, different paths would find me love or success, but all as this &quot;new&quot; person. I could sort of &quot;restart&quot; and play out each scenario however I wanted to, leading to different paths and success, but it always ended up in complete ruin. There was no way to avoid that part and it just sort of &#039;reset&#039;&quot;.<br/>

I also have this one on record. The whole time I was doing this dream log thing I had troubles sleeping each night so I forgot a lot of detail in between. I kinda laugh when I read this. Anyways: &quot;I dreamt that mom and I had moved to a new apartment building. The building was large, each apartment was huge and had multiple rooms to it. The apartment rooms were more like big houses on the inside. I don&#039;t remember much about that part. After physically waking up and going back to sleep, the same dream continued. I had a dream I met Erika (IM) at this place and we were together for a while. Not much to that part because I woke up again. After physically waking up and going back to sleep again the same dream continued. This time I was going back to &lt;my old&gt; school though. Erika was with me. Nothing was different about school, it was just like before even though we&#039;re both older than 21. It was the dead of winter and it was cold, snowy and icy. So cold that &lt;current principal there&gt; told us about a weather warning and a lock in. Everyone was stuck in the gym. That was when Erika showed me that under the stage in the gym there was a room, and a sort of &#039;secret clique&#039;. The others were there and they introduced me. They explained that it was a sort of underground fascist society and that&#039;s where they met at school sometimes. She introduced me to the other Erika I know in real life (We&#039;ll say Erika V). We were all talking and Erika told me that Erika V and I should hook up. Afterwards it turned out there were other people in this little &quot;underground society&quot; and they had a way to instant message them when they were there as well. I&#039;m not sure if they were from the same school or from another school, I just know that they weren&#039;t there so we were messaging. The others also left so I continued messaging them.&quot; That was the last thing I remember before I finally woke up. Pretty abrupt so nothing happened after that.<br/>

I dreamt I was back in grade school and I got in a fight in the classroom. My foe was a kid I remember but never had any problems with. I gorged out his eyes and bit the tip off his nose. During the dream I was unperturbed by the level of violence.
<br/>
<br/>When I woke up I was kind of shocked about the violence.<br/>

This weekend I had a long meandering dream only the end of which I can recall.
<br/>
<br/>I was in my back yard. There was a wolf and a raccoon. The raccoon was bigger than usual, just slightly smaller than the wolf. The wolf took the coon down by biting its leg. It didn&#039;t eat it or kill it all and here&#039;s where it gets weird.
<br/>
<br/>The wolf yelled at the raccoon. In English. It yelled &quot;BIG LARGE SCARY WOLF ANIMAL!&quot; And the raccoon, in a terrified voice, shouted back &quot;BIG LARGE SCARY WOLF ANIMAL!&quot; They went back and forth like this a few times before I decided to leave. I lept about 100 feet and landed on the window of a car door on a nearby street and spoke to my parents about something just before I woke up.
<br/>
<br/>The wolf and the raccoon thing was so weird though. Just these two animals yelling BIG LARGE SCARY WOLF ANIMAL at each other. The wolf wasn&#039;t even all that angry (despite sounding pretty angry about it).<br/>

This is probably my most surreal dream I have written down in my journal. Interestingly enough, it&#039;s also one of my most vivid, and probably the only one I remember from start to finish.
<br/>
<br/> We are children, and we live in some sort of government facility. We are allowed to roam freely. There are several rooms of interest, each one has some sort of panel next to it. The doors to these rooms are typical: oak, windowless, aluminum handle, plain. Each door&#039;s panel is made of plastic, and they all have a slot to place a card in. The cards are located in a deposit box next to the panels. Each has a non-euclidean pattern or shape on it. If one were to place one of the cards in a slot, they could enter the room and explore an environment based on the card.
<br/> We, the children, found out about these rooms and began to explore them even though they were in a restricted area. One of the personnel found us and in an authoritative voice told us &quot;Get out.&quot;, and then moved on to the next room to do the same. All of us cooperate until he comes to the last room, he does his routine and the child yells &quot;No way!&quot;, and then proceeds to take the card from the panel and tear it in half. The guard yells &quot;No!&quot; but fails to stop the child.
<br/> This is when I become an observer rather than a participant. The facility tears apart and reshapes itself into some sort of hellish maze, stone walls and iron plating make up most of the environment. Great chasms open and impossibly empty expanses grow into the ceiling. Lightning flashes every once in a while and monsters roam free. Some fly, some climb, and all are made from various shapes which morph into new shapes. Groups of guards in riot gear attempt to stop the incoming flux of creatures. A brick wall somewhere rises, opening up to a vacuum and taking both monster and guard alike into its void. I see a unit of guards climb a staircase to the top of a mountain-like structure. At the top, an iron gate opens and reveals the greatest amassing of monsters seen yet.<br/>

<br/>Sometimes it&#039;s not hard. Like last night I dreamed that the most laid back boss I had was really angry at me for no reason and it doesn&#039;t take a lot of work to figure out that it was because last night I was doing a new job by myself and was unhappy with myself for not being as fast as the people who usually do it and making mistakes.
<br/>
<br/>Though I&#039;m not gonna lie, I was completely lost at what <a href="/b/res/722687.html#722773" class="ref|b|722687|722773">&gt;&gt;722773</a> is supposed to mean though.
<br/>
<br/>In fact now that I think of it, my dreams are only recently starting to be significant. Usually they&#039;re long bizarre dreams that make no sense and don&#039;t have a central theme.<br/>

<br/>Well, that&#039;s not uncommon. A lot of kids go through phases or whatever and HS has it&#039;s clubs. In the dream it was different because it was like underground/hidden kind of like how fight club was (but without the fighting). Just weird, of all things a secret fascist society. I guess one of the people I mentioned is a legitimate fascist though. It&#039;s just weird trying to understand your dreams. It&#039;s very entertaining when you remember a lot of your dream though.<br/>

Dreaming that I&#039;m walking around in some village which pretty much was just a bloated version of my home, with villagers that practiced some wiccan voodoo and gave me a box filled with small talismans and voodoo dolls made out of wool. They gave me a monkey talisman (carved to look like a monkey) and that was when I realized that I was dreaming and became semi-lucid.
<br/>I tried channeling my energy into the monkey bling-bling to make it alive but when that didn&#039;t work I went to the bathroom and looked at my face in the mirror, telling myself over and over &quot;This is a dream. I am dreaming&quot;. I remembered that whenever I turn lucid and close my eyes in-dream usually causes me to acidentally wake up IRL (which sucks because I like to just sit down in my dreams and meditate), but I wanted to test if I could do it voluntarily (as a test). So I closed my eyes and tried my best to wake myself up, woke up and walked diwnstairs where my dog told me that it wanted to go out and piss on the lawn. So we went out and my dog immediately ran off to hump the neighbour&#039;s dog. THAT was when I realized that I was still dreaming since my dogs a bitch and doesn&#039;t hump other dogs, which caused me to really wake up.
<br/>I find it kinda funny that the fact that my dog talking to me seemed completely ordinary and logical while in turn seeing it having bitch-on-bitch action made the dream collapse.
<br/>
<br/>One thing I am currently looking forward to though is that last week I ordered a thing-a-ma-jigg called a neuromagnetic stimulator, which stimulates the brain like a thai masseur stimulates me on lonely thursday nights. It causes a bunch of varied positive effects on your mind, one of which happens to be intenser lucid dreaming. I&#039;m excited as a kid before christmas to tinker with my toy.<br/>

<br/>That&#039;s why you start keeping a dream journal.
<br/>Seriously, after starting to write down my dreams has my ability to recall them increased markedly. My dreams are also clearer and lucid dreams are more frequent.
<br/>Also, meditating right before going to bed helps.
<br/>Remember your dreams

You guys are lucky to have those kind of dreams. Mine are always of people and communicating in different situations.

<br/>Me again. Actually thinking of this reminded me of a dream I had. I used to open at McD&#039;s all the time and I had this dream that I went in early (~2 am) and just started stealing food and stuff. Then filled up the shake machine so I could make a shake, but by that time that happened someone pulled around in their car. I just turned off the lights and sat still. I think it turned out it was an opening manager who was coming to actually open.
<br/>
<br/>I&#039;m surprised I remember that dream just from memory. That was a while ago. So yeah I guess that one was different, but a lot of times I just dream about work. It&#039;s not that uncommon to have very non-creative dreams.<br/>

<br/>Not space, no. I have a lot of non-creative dreams like what you described, but there were also these ones:

<br/>
<br/>Those creative dreams even like those you referenced do not exist in my dream repertoire. &quot;Just some regular, social situations&quot;... I hate myself. My life is the same thing every time and I don&#039;t know why. I think I care too much.<br/>

Dream and journal entry May 17, Saturday. 
<br/>
<br/>I was playing tennis, or racquetball, or something, like in Wii Sports, except we were playing with an orange rather than a tennis ball, and the wall did not break down after being hit with the ball a few times. The orange would bounce and everything, but it was a bit heavy. We would always hit the ball too hard, or in the wrong direction, and we could never really get a good rally going. I looked at my racquet, and some of the strings or whatever they are called, were coming loose. The was a gap in the middle. 
<br/>
<br/>It&#039;s about nine in the morning now. I am typing this on my second generation iPod Touch that I happened to have under my pillow. The one with the screen that I myself cracked when I dropped it on the bathroom floor. The only screen I ever cracked. The one with audio that is extremely quiet. 
<br/>
<br/>It&#039;s warm now, almost summer, and the whole house fan was just turned off. I will close my window as soon as I get out of bed. 
<br/>
<br/>My cousin will be visiting at Grandmother&#039;s house this weekend. I will come with Father to see her today, because I will not visit Grandmother on Sunday, because of the party at Dylan&#039;s place. 
<br/>
<br/>If I have time, I might make cookies today. If I do, I&#039;ll bring them to the party. 
<br/>
<br/>Father came in and reminded me that he will be leaving soon. 
<br/>
<br/>Mother knocked on my door and spoke quietly, and I did not hear her well, and so I spoke louder. She came in and I asked her what she wanted. She asked me why I was yelling. I said, because I could not hear her, and I assumed she could not hear me. She said &quot;I just wanted to say good-morning.&quot; She then nagged me about not wearing my retainer, (which, by the way, I did not wear today because my teeth are still sore from getting spacers put in between my molars, eight in total.) She the  walked out, saying that I ought not be such a butt. That bothered me a bit, I think. 
<br/>
<br/>I am listening to the Pandora station based upon The Postal Service because Sarah posted a link to one of their songs yesterday, and I thought the words sounded charming. Is charming the right word? I don&#039;t know. 
<br/>
<br/>Anyway, I should probably get up now. I need to be ready to leave in less than an hour. <br/>

Dream May 19 Sunday 
<br/>
<br/>I was in a private boarding school with the dorms divided between the elite business majors and everyone else. I took a drink from a drinking fountain designated for the elite business, got yelled at by a female administrator, and ran back upstairs. It was in the middle of the night, and I found Dylan in the hallway, arguing with Ashley (spelling?) and about two of his other gal friends. I ran up and sat next to them, and Ashley said, &quot;See? Benjamin&#039;s on my side.&quot; (I wasn&#039;t.) and Dylan ran away. But then he came back. 
<br/>
<br/>It&#039;s 6:46 am right now. I&#039;m not usually awake this early on a Sunday. The party that was going to be for today was canceled, so I&#039;ll go to my Grandmother&#039;s house instead. My cousin and her boyfriend fiancé are visiting there. <br/>

I&#039;ve always wanted to lucid dream but I can never manage it. Occasionally I&#039;ll become lucid but then I&#039;ll think oh shit did I oversleep? and panic, then wake myself up to make sure.

<br/>I never did oversleep.<br/>

Woke up 6 o&#039;glock and went back to sleep and had a vivid dream.
<br/>Feom what I remember it started with me being an old man, walking around in a town. I met a young girl, much too young for me and we felt attracted to eachother, so I tried to seduce her. Then suddenly I became my regular self but the old man stayed in the dream as a character. The &quot;real&quot; me met this girl too and I became very much smitten in her and wanted to be with her (she was REALLY beautiful, which is a quite common charasteristic for love interests in dreams). We hanged around a bit and I tagged along with her and the old man to a quaint rustic bar, with an old timey english design, and the people there were mostly on the older side aswell but very nice. There was piano music and the smell of cigarret smoke, whiskey and sweat, and it smelled heavenly. We sat at a table where one of the old man&#039;s acquainances sat and we discussed about love and truth. I looked at a short fat woman with curly darkred hair and dressed in a red dress, as she walked to the bar to talk with its tender. I thought that she looked like a person with much love inside her and looking at her made me feel joy.
<br/>We then left the bar and [have forgotten what happened here]. I and the girl of my dreams went to the bathroom of a big house (which later turned into a candy shop) and we took a shower (in separate booths). The naughty me caught a glance at her in the shower and to my surprise was she wearing two bathrobes around her body and drawing a green and yellow frog in her diary, all while the water was soaking her robes and the paper. I approached her and asked why she wasn&#039;t naked and why she was drawing the the airwolfing shower, to which she became all pissy and shoved me away.
<br/>That was when the old man (who i had grown to really dislike) came into the bathroom and I asked him if he thought it was wise to be robed in the shower and draw, to which he was semi neutral but still tried to gain points with her and said that she could do whatever she wanted.
<br/>Then the shower turned into a toilet and i started to piss (which is a baaaad sign if you are dreaming)and suddenly a bunch of people appeared into what had spawned a dozen toilets. I think I talked to some of them and then [insert the thing that happened, whatever it was]. The bathroom now turned into a candy shop and I walked around in it. The candy was really cheap but I knew that it was all there just to tempt me and I didn&#039;t eat any of it. A kid ran close-by and shouted in joy as he saw a shelf stacked with chocolate eggs wrapped in violet wrapping paper, and I shouted back at him playfully. He laughed and his smiling family came and brought him away. I walked around some more, saw the kid again, tried to make a funny laugh/gesture and he laughed half heartedly (as was my attempt).
<br/>I walked out and met some people, walked around in the market where different goods were sold, amongst which were weapons (swords, bows, schimitars, spears, batons, knives, the works) but I didn&#039;t want to buy any of them because this dream was peaceful and I saw no need for weapons (boy was I wrong).
<br/>Nighttime arrives and I go to the candy shop with the intention to meet the girl, which I do but then some brawl breaks out (probably caused by me, or atleast I was involved) and I try to fight but most of my opponents were much taller than me (which is the case for real life aswell) but I fought as well as I could. Then my opponents started using weapons while I was unarmed (except for my arms) and I cowardly ran away to look for a weapon from the market. Most of the weapons had been either sold or carried away but there was still some left. None of the remaining weapons felt good in my heand and I was determined to find a longsword since I was sure that I was experienced in handling one of those) but all the swords were gone. Time went on and I desperately looked everywhere to find a good sword and I went into a small building at the end of the market promenade. Inside was an old man with a grey beard and I asked him if he had a sword to lend. He went into his cupboards and looked around and I saw him fiddling with a necklace which looked like it resembled a pyramid with a streak in the middle, which I interpreted as an illuminati sign. I confronted him about it, saying something like &quot;ah, it seems i&#039;ve found another illumed brother&quot; and was all smirky about it. He first tried to deny it but then sighed and agreed to give me better aid. He fiddled with the cupboard and did some magic thing to open a secret drawer which had the word &quot;sex&quot; written on it with fancy medieval lettering. He searched in it for something and I sat down on the floor beside him. Atlast he found what he was looking for and pulled out three glass fkasks (which were nicely attached to eachother) containing a blue liquid, and took one out of them. He told me to drink it but I asked what it contained. He hesitantly said that it was a lust potion which would make me concentrate on the girl in the dream and make want to sing her lovesongs, to which I replied something along the lines of &quot;DUDE, I am looking for something to help me fight, and my dick isn&#039;t very good at fencing!&quot;, to which he was all like &quot;oh...&quot; and he gave me a sword instead. FINALLY! I thanked him (i hope. Would have been rude not to) and but just as I was about to walk out I saw that it was light outside and that morning had come. I saw through the window a handful of men on horses and as I walked out one of them saw me and seemed to be searching for me and my head. Then the old illumed brotha stepped out and said (without noticing the horsed men) that I should be careful and make sure that nobody saw us togheter, but when he saw the horsemen (who also saw and had heard him) he froze mid sentence and moonwalked back into his home.
<br/>
<br/>The chase was on. Me on foot and the horsemen on horses. I ran. The men came after. I continued running. They were gaining on me. I ran through the streets and the horses couldn&#039;t handle the cobblestone streets too well, but their hunting dog was still on my ass. I turned around and told it to sit, which it oddly enough obeyed and just stayed there while I ran off (I don&#039;t know if that means it was well or poorly trained).
<br/>The police had been alerted and now they were after me aswell, but I managed to avoid them. Oh, and I had acquired a bike at this point. The police cars were getting more aggressive and finally I just gave up of running and decided to talk to the police.
<br/>The cars drove to me slowly and out stepped... a bunch of friends I had met at the market! I was so freaking happy andhugs and kisses were all around, but the girl wasn&#039;t there... They told me the fight had calmed down pretty quickly so my search for the sword had been semi in vain. Oh well.
<br/>I stepped into one of the cars and we drove off onto the highway. I wanted to jam some music so I started clapping various parts of the car to find a good sound and finally found a mug, a metal stick and a dvd case. I tried keeping the beat but something was off and the tunes didn&#039;t really take off. Then suddenly were we all at a classroom and a teacher told me to stop drumming.
<br/>He then continued with a lecture by reading off a powerpoint, but he skipped a bunch of facts (Which to me seemed important and interesting) and he just put on a simpsons episode and told the class that &quot;this short film will explain this better than me&quot; but it was just a regular episode (one of the new ones. It was agony). I thought this was bollocks and confronted the teacher and told him to step up his teaching game, to which he responded with disdain and tried to throw me out of the class room (Is anybody even reading this? ah, who cares). The rest of the class was with him and threw garbage at me and I pleaded that I&#039;d be given 1 minute to defend myself and my point, which I was allowed. I started asking questions of the classmates and made it into a song (I had become Jack Black or something) and the athmosphere improved greatly and it was really fun. The girl of my dreams had now appeared in the room and my heart was beating off like crazy. I wanted to make her mine with my kickass song and it seemed to be working. But then the teacher interrupted me and said that 1,5 minutes had already passed and that I didn&#039;t get to stay in the classroom.
<br/>Then something happened and I woke up.
<br/>It was the most intense and longest dream I&#039;ve had in ages.
<br/>End.
<br/>
<br/>So yeah, if you want to have intense dreams:
<br/>1. wake up a bit earlier
<br/>2. go to sleep while i listened to a relaxation tape and it&#039;s really good, it doesn&#039;t have any bullshit. It&#039;s just straight up instructions on how to relax (search for torrent: anatomy and physiology made easy with yoga)
<br/>3. ???
<br/>4. wake up and write that shit down.<br/>

Just awoke from a long dream in the middle of the day.
<br/>
<br/>To be brief about it, I managed to get a wind surfing board to fly by wearing a cape, replacing the board&#039;s sail with a pig, and coaxing it with small plastic pipes and random Spanish phrases. It was a very relaxing dream.<br/>

Dream May 24 Saturday 7:23 am
<br/>
<br/>I was in some sort of gigantic space ship or space station. I was with a group of people in a pod, but they were going to be searched, so I took my things and went down a corridor and around the corner into another room and hid my things behind a control panel of some sort. I then went back to the pod and they were about to leave. I said, wait, and they opened the door, and I stepped out. The door closed, and the pod whooshed off into space. I looked into the space where the pod had been and I saw illusions similar to those of Antichamber. I then talked to a fat human who was a resident of the place I at. Hillvill or something was the name of the planet or city or whatever where I was. I said, &quot;So, what&#039;s it like in Hillville?&quot; and he said, &quot;It&#039;s called Hilltown.&quot; (Or whatever the name was, I don&#039;t remember.) I then walked down the corridor into a main area of the station, and there was a sphere similar to those of the McDonalds play-places, but much larger, and because of the weak gravity I was able to jump up the ceiling and back. Then I was with some other people, students perhaps. I was taken into another room because I did not have enough homework. It was there that the person, probably an academic counselor, asked about some person, who was in Disneyland. Then I was in an actual building with her, that resembled her office, and Korra was there. I then went out onto the land and pushed aside a potted plant to reveal a gap in the fence, and continued on to the beach, where there was a battle being fought. A soldier come toward me. Now, I don&#039;t know if it was me who fought him, and I was just seeing myself from outside my body, or it was someone else, but that person grabbed the soldier, held him upside down and began stabbing him with an object that resembled a ballpoint pen. He was screaming and struggling, but I or whoever, turned him over and began stabbing his chest, and then his neck. I continued to stab his neck until his head fell off. It rolled a few feet, and my iPod just happened to be there and there was a picture on the screen of the disembodied head, still moving its face. I took my iPod and ran back to my counselor&#039;s office and showed the picture to her, and said &quot;I killed a guy. I cut off his head.&quot; I was very upset. <br/>

<br/>That&#039;s not lucid dreaming, you were only dreaming that you had control of your dream. It&#039;s a common confusion, especially for people who are trying to lucid dream.<br/>

<br/>Haha, nice! Thanks for sharing. I had a dream last night, but I had nothing beneath my pillow, so I forgot it. It was quite the dream, too.<br/>

<br/>Yeah you know, mine too... I should&#039;ve typed it down. Oh well. I remembered the most important part, I can&#039;t believe I did that.
<br/>And most of all, I can&#039;t believe what I did with that power xD<br/>

<br/>Thank you for reading.
<br/>
<br/>This nights dream incoming, though not nearly as pleasant as the previous one.
<br/>
<br/>I am the cook at a festival and arranging the days ingredients on a cupboard. One of the crew-members approach me and tell me I&#039;m doing a bang up job at feeding the workers, so I flip him a thumbs up, leap out the window and land on the first floor of an apartment building. The walls are yellow and soft musak is played through a black stereo, which lays on a brown wooden table to the right of me.
<br/>Suddenly a man in a suit walks past me towards the elevator and decide to follow him. The elevator doors close behind me and he pushes the button for the second floor. We elevate. *ding. We arrive at the same floor we just left, only the elevator we had walked into is on the other side of the room. Slightly mindairwolfed at this moment and have a feeling that this is all a dream. The suited man walks out and I follow. He passes the room and walks into the same elevator on the other side. I follow. The doors behind us begin to close, but then suddenly the doors open again and a 4-5 people rush inside. One of them, an Asian guy with cool sunglasses, whips out an electrical magic wand (think Dr. Who&#039;s sonic screwdriver) and points it at the elevator&#039;s ceiling. [my observing perspective changes briefly and I can see the elevator cables breaking]. The elevator stars falling at a great speed, so fast that it descends faster than our bodies and makes it seem that we are levitating.
<br/>I shout out &quot;IT&#039;S LIKE A ROLLER COASTER&quot; just to break the ice as none of us had said anything during this ordeal, all while the speed of the elevator dropping increased in momentum and I was worrying that it could hurt when it would crash. Faster and faster..
<br/>*ding
<br/>the doors open. All is fine and nobody seems surprised that we&#039;re alive and we walk out into an orange-hued reception room. The suited man approaches the clerk, who gives him a form to fill out. Asian guy &amp; co walk into a room to the left of us. I get the sense that there is something sinister about this place.
<br/>I walk up to the clerk and ask what kind of place this was but he only answered with giving me the same form as to the suit. I ask the suit what I&#039;m supposed to do and he answers &quot;fill it&quot;
<br/>and points at the paper in front of me. The first thing on the form were three choices which all were philosophical statements pertaining to the meaning of life on this planet/density/dimension and it was something like:
<br/>
<br/>&quot;The meaning in this state of life is:
<br/>1. to rise and expand in consciousness.e
<br/>2. to break the cycle of karma.
<br/>
<br/>the third statement transformed into a comic strip and was pretty similar to the first one, but I though that the comic was nicer so I chose to encircle it.
<br/>Then the clerk took the form away from my hands and gave me a red-brown ticket and an ID. I told him I hadn&#039;t finished filling the form but he said there wasn&#039;t enough time to do so since the &quot;assembly&quot; was about to start.
<br/>I walked towards the door which led to the supposed assembly, gave my ticket to the .. ticketeer(?), who ripped the rippable part off it.
<br/>The auditorium where the assembly were to be had was rather small but it felt huge for some reason. There were still plenty of empty, blue velvet seats. My assigned seat number was 3:26 but I didn&#039;t have enough time to reach it before someone told me to pick a random seat and so I sat down.
<br/>Everyone hushed.
<br/>Silence.
<br/>Two aliens appear, one of which I only remember the appearance of. Her skin was caucasian but her head was oval with large black eyes, a mix of a (&#039;grey alien&#039; and anunaki).
<br/>She approached a podium which faced the other way of me, so I mostly just saw her back, and started talking an alien language. A translator started translating what she said but then she told him that she forgot that she should speak &quot;human&quot; instead, and suddenly I understood what she said.
<br/>Her exact words are a bit fuzzy but the overall idea was that she was evil but not in the classical sense. More like in the sense that good and evil are the same thing of a spectrum and that though in my eyes may she appear evil is she compared good to the forces she is battling. Or something like that.
<br/>For some reason I thought that she was able to read the thoughts of everyone present in the room and was worried she’d find out that I wasn’t evil, so I tried concentrating on evil thoughts. But then it struck me. I didn’t even have to pretend to be evil. It wasn’t necessary because I was evil as it is.. THAT was quite an eye-opener (not literally of course) and certainly not a pleasant one.
<br/>She continued talking and had acquired an ill fit blond wig and then the assembly ended. I talked with a couple of elder men in grey suits who said, in a cryptic manner, that “there are nice PERKS and much to GAIN if you join” and pointed at their penises (indicating that … well, you know). I still felt as if I was undercover and didn’t want to blow it, so I tried my best at seeming interested in what they were saying. Then suddenly time seemed to freeze and the men I was talking to stared at me as if they looked into my soul and said in-sync and monotonously “YOU DO NOT BELONG HERE” and I was zapped out of that place and woke up.<br/>

a recent dream involved me being back at school and confroting a lad that used to bully me, at first it was the old &quot;too weak to damage them&quot; trope but then things sort of &#039;reset&#039; as if loading a quicksave in a game, behind the Bully i notice an empty wine bottle (odd for a school but hell it&#039;s a dream seemed normal at the time), i pick up the bottle and shatter it on the bullie&#039;s head keeping hold of the jagged neck of the bottle, which i then proceeded to stab into his neck shouting &quot;check my nigga knife Bitch!&quot; which seemed to render the violence in my dream comical when i woke, Once i had stabbed into his neck i was rotating the bottle in an attempt to make him bleed out and after a few twists his neck pissed blood across the room, i awoke shortlt afterwards thought &quot;that was airwolfed!&quot; then remembered what i said in it and started laughing<br/>

I recently had a dream. I wasn&#039;t able to type it out that morning, so I forgot most of it. However, I do remember that I was looking at a computer screen, and I could clearly make out multiple windows and read the on screen text. I thought I was not supposed to be able to do this in dreams, just like how you&#039;re not supposed to be able to see your reflection clearly in a mirror while dreaming?<br/>

<br/>I&#039;m a child again
<br/>I&#039;m running through a field with my dad and some of his friends.
<br/>I don&#039;t know why we&#039;re running. Then, I look back.
<br/>A spinosaurus is chasing us.
<br/>Ok den. I keep running, and I seem to be keeping ahead of the dinosaur.
<br/>Suddenly, we&#039;re running through an old ruin of a house. We reach the back of the house and everyone jumps out of a window, one at a time.
<br/>It gets to be my turn, I&#039;m last of course, and I find that I can&#039;t get through.
<br/>I panic and start screaming for my dad but he&#039;s not there, nobody is.
<br/>I look back (somehow) in time to see the open jaws of the dinosaur ready to eat me.
<br/>The dream ends.<br/>

<br/>Haha, oh that feeling like everyone moved on to happiness by escaping, leaving you behind for the worst.
<br/>
<br/>Like every &quot;horror&#039; dream I&#039;ve ever had.
<br/>
<br/>If it makes you feel any better about that shitty truth, bear in mind that those people that escaped will look back at you and say &quot;wow, he faced death. he got to know what not only extreme pain feels like, he now knows what death is like. He endured that pain right to his death.&quot;
<br/>
<br/>Meanwhile they are doing nothing with themselves, sitting at home playing a video game.
<br/>
<br/>There. Now I win, and they lose.
<br/>That&#039;s literally the only thing that keeps me from hurling bombshells at the fact that in my dreams I am always the last to do something, and end up getting caught.
<br/>
<br/>airwolf you all.<br/>

I was in my room hanging up my jacket when I turn and se a girl standing there. She looked normal, but seemed disturbing. I stared at her while pictures flow through my head, like memories or something like they were somehow my pictures with experiences tied to them or some sort of idea or concept. She said in the most aggressive devilish voice &quot;NONSENSE&quot;. I then said &quot;SENSENON&quot;, only thing that came to mind. She then started screaming and she had this weird cheap style teleport motion. She kept moving around in my room like when your moving your mouse really fast exactly like that. Then she disappeared. I awoke and she was standing at the edge of my bed, I stared only to realize she had no eyes. I then awoke. Weird dreams like this keep continuing, not the weird girl but the pictures, theyre exactly the same everytime, I can&#039;t remember them percisely but I remember thinking these are the exact same pictures that flowed through my head the last time I remember pictures flowing through my head.<br/>

I&#039;ve recently taken to writing down my dreams in a journal. This one is pretty surreal:
<br/>
<br/>First person. I&#039;m standing at the lowest point of a snowy suburban road that curves up at either side. My mother,
<br/>grandmother, and brother E are there. I repeatedly tell E not to play in the road. He does not listen. A large
<br/>white mail truck passes by and crushes his leg underneath it. E begins to scream. I pick up pieces of bone and tendon
<br/>and put them in a trash bag that my mother is holding. She says that he will never walk again, but appears calm. E
<br/>continues to scream. I run until it gets dark.
<br/>Third person semi-omniscient. I watch as an older man leads my brother J into his home. The man is dressed in a dark coat. He has
<br/>a mass of wavy gray hair, but it doesn&#039;t descend past his shoulders. He asks J what the product is of two
<br/>identical matrices [2, 1, 2, 1] is. J doesn&#039;t answer. My own answer is 4. The older man says that is incorrect, directed towards J.
<br/>The true answer is 173. I revise my own answer to 8, then 16. The man leads J down a dark staircase inside his home.
<br/>Dead trees line either side of the staircase. At the bottom, a vast, unending darkness spreads out. The only light comes
<br/>from the door the old man has opened. A dark shape that I assume to be J walks through, though I can no longer see
<br/>his face. A monster with emaciated limbs grabs at him. It stands about 16 feet tall. During the dream I identified it
<br/>as mosquito-like, but now it seems more akin to an alien with similar body proportions to a pterodactyl from the waist up. However, it did
<br/>not possess wings, and I refused to look at the writhing mass of flesh that it&#039;s torso sat upon. It had 4 jaws in an
<br/>x pattern that it held open motionlessly. The form took a curious step forward. The monster immediately shoved the form
<br/>into it&#039;s mouth. It used its jaws to push it&#039;s prey down its throat. I got a closer view of the creature. All that was
<br/>left visible of the monster&#039;s meal was a head. However, it was the head didn&#039;t belong to J. Instead, it was that of a humanoid lizard, peering out emotionlessly from
<br/>the monsters gullet.
<br/>First person. I&#039;m at the edge of a pool underneath a wooden balcony. I&#039;m with two brothers, 12 to 14. I&#039;m around their
<br/>age. I dump a bag of reeses pieces into the pool, which is 12 feet deep. I dive and look at them, covering most of the
<br/>pools bottom. I don&#039;t take any. The balcony disappears. I tell the brothers that the alien/monster will use mind control
<br/>to lure us to it in order to eat us. They become agitated.
<br/>First person. We are in the brothers room, and I am fighting both of them. I hit them both until they are on the ground,
<br/>weeping. I stab the older one in the face with a fork repeatedly. He gets up, and the facade of tears is gone. He tells me that I
<br/>won&#039;t be able to kill the alien with my strength. I do not believe that they are aligned with the alien, only that they
<br/>are against me. I jump out of their second story window. It is now dark outside. I am on the right side of &lt;redacted&gt; street, running. The screen from their window is hanging from my shoulder, blinding me on my left side. I run up the
<br/>street, towards my house.<br/>

<br/>OK. This is me. After reading dreams here that I no longer have, and as a result, being angrily frustrated, I will literally type out the next ones I remember.
<br/>
<br/>This is really starting to upset me, after each night I wake up with a sense of &quot;how incredibly boring that was&quot;.
<br/>
<br/>I don;t think I used to have dreams this bad. It only started around the time I was starting to fend for myself in the world without parental care. I think I hyper focus on the minute social details to the point where it consumes my thoughts right into sleep, because if I &quot;stop&quot; thinking about it, I will lose the ability to leave a good presentation to people and forget everything and as a result, lose my job like all other cases in the past. Under the aid of parental care I was still permitted to be in my own little world.<br/>

Dream, 6.29.14 Sunday
<br/>I was looking at a box set of what appeared to be the first two seasons or two series perhaps of Avatar: the Last Airbender. It was brown, and about as big as a small filing cabinet. There were numbers on the outside, seeming to represent episodes or books or something. The first was labeled &quot;1 2 3 4 9&quot; or something like that, and the other part was labeled with about ten times that many numbers, but I remember it started with &quot;1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 4&quot; or something like that. I mentioned to my friend, who was beside me that they did not make sense. I assumed that he would be able to make sense of it all, because, you know, he&#039;s that sort of guy. At first he said that of course it makes sense, but he agreed with me after a moments look at the numbers. I then raised my voice and said &quot;Amian! Yo no comprendo los números!&quot; (I guess I had given up on calling her Arrok by this point.) Anyway, she came over from where she was in the other room by the Christmas tree, and she said, yeah, let me show you. She started flipping buckles and latches, opening and closing the two main doors. She said it was kinda broken, so she picked it up, and asked for me to give her a hand. She told me not to hold it by the leg, and I noticed the leg was rather bendy. At this point, my friend&#039;s grandmother clock went &quot;bong!&quot; eight times, and it woke me up. Clocks really tick me off sometimes. (Get it?)<br/>

I had a &quot;problem&quot; a week ago. I tried to have meaningless sex with I girl I met the same week, I couldn&#039;t stay hard. She was a bitch about it, laughed and told me &quot;are you serious? I feel like accomplished nothing!&quot;... I dreamed that I was in class with her (I met her at work so I don&#039;t know why I was dreaming about her in class) and the teacher asked her to say a sentence... She said something like &quot;Men should be able to satisfy woman&quot; I remember I stood up, approached her and said &quot;Maybe if you were a bit attractive while naked&quot;... Shit sucks, I wish her the worst. Maybe it was my subconscious trying to get a revenge or something.<br/>

<br/>There was a black void, and then I woke up three hours earlier than usual, severly disoriented but not panicked. No dreams yet, but it&#039;s just the second night and I was taking half-dosage to acclimate. Tonight it&#039;s the full dose!<br/>

Had this dream when I was 14.
<br/>I was lying in a wet environment. Some kind of puddle in a flooded house. I am on my back. A girl I know shows up, removes my undergarments and plays fiddlesticks. Suddenly I woke up with about 3 tablespoons of cum in my underwear. Classic teen wet dream.<br/>

This is one I had about 3 years ago.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Myself and many other unknown persons were in my house during what was only referred to as some sort of &quot;invasion&quot; by an unknown entity which was coming from the South, however, the cardinal directions of just North and South were flipped. Our only known way of escaping this entity (sometimes referred to as a virus) was traveling to the Northwest. Among this rather large group of people was an odd little girl, no older than nine who seemed to be dressed in late nineteenth or early twentieth Century clothing. Also, another female was there who I was incredibly distrustful of. She seemed to be some kind of catalyst in aiding this virus, but the others viewed my assumptions as false. As we were loading up our vehicles in the drive-way and in the street, this unseen attack began. I did not actually see any of my allies being attacked, as I was running inside to check on the little girl previously mentioned. I assume someone told her to stay inside to be safe. Myself, and a man with long, jet black hair, pale skin and wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt went into the room she was in. Upon entering, only a pale yellow box sat upon the bed. Again, where I assume she was sitting. When I opened the box, I pulled out a skull-like object with holes for eyes and a beak-like protrusion in the center of its face, albeit it was very simple in structure; nowhere like an actual skull. I looked to the man with me; he was facing away, almost like he was attempting to run, as I asked &quot;What is this?&quot; The skull floated as a low, droning sound began and a voice in my head in a calm, male voice told me: &quot;I am Death&quot;.<br/>

<br/>In elementary school both my brother and myself had an odd dream about being at school and it being infested by giant, eusocial spiders. The playground equipment was covered in webs. At least in my dream, I was bitten by a spider and several friends were eaten. I woke up with actual pain like a bee sting.
<br/>
<br/>Why would two people have the same odd dream?<br/>

When I was like 16, note I had this dream after watching Afro Samurai and eating really spicy chinese food. They&#039;re was some holiday party or something in the caffeteria. I was just standing on the side in the room and somebody was carrying in like a giant tub of really hot soup and tripped. The soup spilled out and I watched as my fellow students were burned through like acid, people laying in wake of the destruction as they&#039;re trying to cling on to what ever life is left within their bodies. Watching people trying to crawl away as just a torso. Then another person walks in and trips with another barrel/container of soup and this one spills on me. I wind up on my knees, looking down, watching my intestines pour out of me, and I struggle to grab at them and push them back in me, and they&#039;re all just pouring out...Needless to say it was a &quot;bloody mess&quot;.<br/>

Dream July 19, 2014
<br/>
<br/>I was in some sort of spaceship, and I was wearing headphones that looked like red beats. I could feel the air rushing past the headphones and into my ears because I guess the air pressure in space is weird. I pressed my hands upon the headphones and created a better seal, but as soon as I let go, the whooshing sound would resume. There was only a handful of other people in the room. They kept drilling big holes in the floor next to me that almost sucked me out into the vacuum of space, so I had to continuously move about the room to avoid that.<br/>

Lived in my old apartment building in the second floor close to the street, the moons gravity airwolfed up and it fell to earth but it shrunk to the diameter of a two story building and it rolled down the street and as it passed everyone grabbed their stomachs as if they were going to vomit, the Moon was pulling us towards it as it rolled by but it was only strong enough to yank on our intestines for a few second.

You can only dream things you have done. After going to a gun range and using hand guns, hand guns started to work in my dreams.

<br/>Spree killing with hand guns. Funny thing is I&#039;m a totally peaceful guy, haven&#039;t killed anything in my life and don&#039;t want to (fish don&#039;t count).

One day I had this dream. Nothing special, some stupid heist crap that was too boring to remember. But in my dream I had to get a getaway car. And what happened next was the best airwolfing dream I ever had.
<br/>
<br/>As I&#039;m choosing a car (a silver Rav 4 that resembled my car at the time) Jack Nicholson pops up out of nowhere and says &quot;Let’s test this bitch&quot; as he points to a car driving off the lot. Everything stops. &quot;Freeze Frame&quot; by J Geils Band starts playing, showing a new photo of the other car driving off the lot (it was a Maroon Mini-Van) for each snap shot in the intro.
<br/>
<br/>As the actual music starts it cuts to me and Jack in the Rav chasing this car down a road in the middle of nowhere. It&#039;s a dirt road with red desert sand on either side. When the song gets to the 50 second mark of the song (not to good with musical terms, so I&#039;ll just use the music video for reference) the Mini Van veers to the right, off road into the desert. Me and Jack follow suit, determined to catch this bitch. A sandstorm of red dust billows behind each car as we speed through the desert.
<br/>
<br/>As we get to the chorus (around 1:20) both cars break into pieces and fly outward like a silent explosion. The driver of the late Mini Van is revealed to be a woman with the face of Amanda Bynes, the body of a gender swapped Dr. Eggman and pink beehive hair. We are both still riding through the desert giving chase at this time. However instead of us being in cars, Jack and I are now riding a single decorative pillow with tassels on the corners. She too is riding a pillow now and even more dust is trailing behind us as our pillows skip like rocks across the sand.
<br/>
<br/>This continues until the song gets to around 2:12. Then, as the music gets slower, she suddenly slows down. Jack Nicholson lays us both on our backs as she bounces on top of us, screaming profanities at her the entire time she is getting behind us. The music picks up and now she is the one chasing us! We head back towards the dealership and as the chorus starts again (about 2:50) we ditch the pillow and hoof it like a Kenyan. We see the car dealer as we approach the lot and tell him to run. He doesn&#039;t hesitate and I take this opportunity to look behind us. She&#039;s on foot now to running like the Terminator in hot pursuit. I turn to see where I&#039;m going and then look back. Now she is running like a velociraptor and still gaining. I turn again and look again. Terminator. Turn. Velociraptor. Finally, as the song ends, the view zooms out as we near the car dealership building, safe from that crazy bitch. Then I forced myself awake so I could remember every single detail.
<br/>
<br/>TL;DR: Me and Jack Nicholson chase a fat bitch with pink hair in the desert and then she starts chasing us all to the tune of &quot;Freeze Frame.&quot;<br/>

Dream Monday August 4, 8:42am
<br/>
<br/>I was in a campground with my family and the RV. We were in an RV park. Our motorhome was in two places at once, and Father and I were carrying firewood from one place to another, the destination being downhill. To get there, I had to walk past other motorhomes, and it was very muddy, with all the water that was flowing uphill. At the other motorhome there was an unidentified guy, probably family or friend, trying to start a fire. He put a bicycle pump beneath the fire to act as bellows, and the campfire looked like a torch when he pumped the bike pump. People were making a commotion downhill and I went to see that the bridge had been flooded. The entire valley was beginning to flood. I ran back uphill to the RV and used the restroom. I saw water flooding in from over the hills. Then we were in the RV of some family friends, which is a much nicer RV than ours, and as the last of the campground flooded, we were a yacht. A dog was swimming in the water, and it jumped up beside us. It was all muddy, and the family friend who owned the RV told it to go away, so it hopped back into the water and swam away. But while on board, it had gotten my shirt muddy, so I asked if there were paper towels. There were, and I cleaned my shirt the best I could. Then we were coming to a cliff, rather similar to the lip of a bowl filled with water, about to overflow. I said we ought to go back, but the driver insisted on going forward. The ship went over the cliff, and plunged into the water. It sunk very deep, but floated to the surface, with everyone still on board and alive. In this lower lake, we came across an old fisherman.<br/>

<br/>i always survive when i die in dreams.
<br/>like,breathing underwater or changing direction before hitting the ground, etc.
<br/>those moments help to get into lucid dreaming.<br/>

Masturbated yesterday after a two week break and had the first sexual dream in two months last night. It was very vivid and rather unpleasant. I don&#039;t want to indulge you of its contents, but it ended with me just going &quot;Nah, airwolf this. Shit&#039;s too airwolfed up for my taste&quot; and walking away in the dream.<br/>

This dream is kind of an oxymoron, both surreal and mundane at the same time.
<br/>
<br/>My father and I walk through a large convenience store. He talks to a clerk, then picks out a box of
<br/>medication from a shelf. I ask him what it is, but am unsure of his response. I assume that it is ritalin for my
<br/>daughter, who I imagine to be around fifteen, and have straight, shoulder length black hair. I don&#039;t realize I couldn&#039;t
<br/>have a kid at four years old. He thinks that it will help her &quot;come out of her shell&quot;. I become angry at dad. We take it
<br/>to checkout, which looks like an airport security terminal. Dad places the medicine on a conveyor belt, and tells
<br/>me that the medication is for her acne. I calm down. A pimply Chris Farley is at the same checkout with his mother. He
<br/>looks slightly uncomfortable. His face strains, and one of the boils on his chin bursts. Someone takes a chisel-like
<br/>tool and gently scrapes the pus from his chin.<br/>

I was standing on a cold, dark room; the only lighting was the sunlight comming from the cracks in the wall and my lucky lighter.
<br/>I could only hear the cars on the street downstairs, but for some reason I was afraid to go near the window; suddenly from the darkness a grave voice creeps trough my skull.
<br/>I could not understand what it said, but it led me to a green book where I ussually write all the shit I think about on my daily life; however, most of the pages were torn and the rest were all white, not even impresion markings.
<br/>
<br/>I took the book and a pen that I found on my pocket and began looking around aimlessly. Then the voice spoke to me again, this time I could understand it.
<br/>he said &quot;find the secrets of the Sabbath&quot;
<br/>And markings on the walls began appearing, I rushed to draw them all on my book but I woke up before finishing them.
<br/>
<br/>When I woke up I went straight for my book and began drawing all the symbols I could remember, the book itself must be around here somewhere, I&#039;ll post it if I find it.<br/>

I usually don&#039;t remember my dreams, but today I saw two and I remember both.
<br/>In the first one I was in a bus and a suicide bomber sat next to me. I started screaming and then BOOM, I woke up panting.
<br/>It was very distressing as I usually don&#039;t remember my dreams, so it took a couple of seconds for me to figure out what happened.
<br/>I went back to sleep after calming down and (as is usual with secondary sleep) I remember the dream I had as well. This one was much nicer as I was, for some reason, at my aunt&#039;s house with my cousins, and I was kissing Noel Fielding. (I know, &quot;wtf?&quot;)
<br/>
<br/>I&#039;ve been waiting for a dream to remember since this thread started, but alas I haven&#039;t had any (not until today).<br/>

I was dead asleep last night. My girlfriend just split on me so I&#039;ve been dreaming about that a lot lately but last night some guy and girl come out of a bar yelling at each other. Like screaming at each other. I was so tired I didn&#039;t wake up but I dreamt that I was screaming at my ex gf.
<br/>
<br/>It&#039;s interesting how things happening outside can affect your dreams.<br/>

There was a swimming pool that was several stories deep. If I timed my jumps just right, I could reach the bottom, and then I would rise quickly to the surface and fly through the air as if the pool were a trampoline.<br/>

I dreamed I was in a sword fight. I killed two people, a man and a woman. I could feel their bones as I stabbed them. I stabbed the woman in the chest and my sword stopped at her spine. I tried to cut off the man&#039;s head, but again, my sword stopped at his spine. There was only a little blood.<br/>

I was sitting in a jungle surrounded by Africans sacrifice people at some altar on a hill. I saw some dude jump off. I didn’t understand why I was there or remember anything, this was the start of the part where I gain a bit of the lucidity of being awake without knowing that I’m actually dreaming.
<br/>
<br/>One of the men performing the sacrifices came over to my area. I picked up a small throwing axe off the ground, and told a small African child to stab the man in the back. I then jumped on his back and began to decapitate the man sloppily. When I had severed his head, the african child then placed the man’s head on his back like one of those beheading videos.
<br/>
<br/>I began to run away and shoot at people with a semi-automatic rifle I had picked up and then was shot at by some very large african. I killed the large african, but a smaller female african shot at me with something and I died from that. Then I woke up.<br/>

I keep having this reoccurring dream where I go down this hill into someones backyard. I run through the side yard and into the street. I look back and notice the house. It never feels right when I look at it. I turn and continue running. I realize that I am in my own neighborhood and run toward my house. I run in grab my shotgun and go to turn on the lamp. I never make it past this point and never remember what happens before.<br/>

I had a relatively interesting dream just last night.
<br/>The details are a bit fuzzy but it involved a hot chick from my childhood and an old man (who happened to be my best friend). Of course, I have never met the old man. He was just a figment of my snoozing consciousness but our friendship felt so real.
<br/>
<br/>Near the end of my dream I remember the girl telling me that my friend was to be executed by hanging today. She and I parkour&#039;d out way to the town squared where I watched him step up to the gallow and dying. It was a rather interesting dream. Wish I remembered more.<br/>

Had this dream only once but for some reason it was the most vivid and stuck with me for a long time. I was at my friend&#039;s villa/summerhouse (he doesn&#039;t have one) and I picked up a parasol while I was on the balcony and it lifted me about three meters into the air. Next thing I remember I am having sex with my friend&#039;s older sister (he doesn&#039;t have one) in the next room to where my friend is having sex with his gf. Can&#039;t remember what happened next, but as I am leaving his summer house turns to a huge log cabin and it&#039;s winter outside. I keep walking and as I am walking through a humungous library I&#039;m suddenly in a huge indoor playground. Kids are playing everywhere and as I keep walking one of my old childhood friends (which I haven&#039;t seen for probably 15-20 years) runs into me. He looks angry and upset as I realize that I had stopped him from winning a race against some other kids. I keep walking and this old tv is in front of me showing something similar to the dancing skeleton gif. It&#039;s chanting something in another language I can&#039;t understand, louder and louder and then I wake up. Definitely one of the weirdest dreams I&#039;ve had and for some reason I can&#039;t forget it which I do with all my other dreams within minutes of waking up.<br/>

Dream September 21, 2014
<br/>I was hanging out with Susia and Carl and we came upon some sort of large school that looked kinda like a movie theater. We stopped at the restroom and became separated. I walked away from the school and saw Kimi and her mom driving away. I walked back to the school and a girl I kinda knew asked if we were going away, but I wasn&#039;t sure if she was talking to me, so I just kept walking. I was wearing cargo shorts and I had a second gen iPod and old Apple earbuds in my pockets. My iPod connected automatically to the school&#039;s wifi and I begun to stream an album off YouTube. I entered the school and thought about where Susia might be. I went to the library, and looked around a bit before I found her. She was sitting at a table drawing with pencil and black marker. We hugged a very nice hug. I told her I had to go to my sixth period class, as the time was already 6:38, and I was 38 minutes late. I stood up to go, and we said thank you and goodbye and then I left the library. I found my father outside, who was to take me home.<br/>

I usually recall a lot of my dreams, and have very unusual ones almost every other night. Recently I&#039;ve been getting more than friendly with an online weeb-friend and I guess that&#039;s why I dreamed this.
<br/>
<br/>It is really early morning, and I&#039;m sat in some cafe on the top of a mountain. I can see the sun rise through these all too large windows. I&#039;m the only person in this cafe and all though it&#039;s ridiculously early they are preparing breakfasts. I order coffee and toast like I eat every morning and sit down in front of the window. This really cute Asian girl walks into the cafe and sits opposite me. She starts to get angry at me because I didn&#039;t tell her that I was leaving. I apologise to her using the name she calls herself over the internet. The waitress comes with my coffee and toast, and I split it with the Asian girl. The mountain cafe turns into some beachside cafe as I drink my coffee and share toast with the girl in front of me. She kisses me lightly on the lips and says that she&#039;s going to miss me and walks out of the cafe while I finish my coffee and watch the sun rise over the waves.
<br/>
<br/>It felt really nice.<br/>

Dream October 1st, 5:17 am
<br/>
<br/>I dreamt dreamed I was in the family room of my house and I was trying to photograph Jess and Ace for my digital photo class, but Jess kept walking around, smirking no less, and whenever I pointed my camera at Ace, the shutter just stopped working. I later learned that Jake was going to be running for president with the Libertarian Party nomination. Then I was in my bedroom with an acquaintance of mine. He was short and his shirt had no top button. It was in the middle of the night, and I was standing by the door, slightly ajar. Mother suddenly burst into my room and yelled &quot;THE TOURNAMENT ATE YOU TOO?!?!?&quot;. I found it hard to respond, because she knocked the wind out of me when she burst into my room.<br/>

Sometimes I have the weirdest dreams. Most of the time they are centered around my somewhat American Indian ancestry. I am 1/4 Blackfoot i was told, never cared to research that origin but i seen some relatives on that side of the family. ANYWAY
<br/>
<br/>This one dream I had about a month ago or so, I was on horseback with I believe was a war party. In that war party it was Myself and at least +40 others. The season must have been early-Mid fall, for the air seemed cold and the little trees around where almost completely bare. We all had our faces painted and some were in regalia such as Feathered bonnets and porcupine roaches.We were crossing a river, and when they spoke in my dream they spoke fluent Blackfoot, and like i could understand them completely and even exchanged words about where we were heading. We were heading to an Assiniboine Sioux camp about a days ride away. We camped at this site on the river creek and the men were practicing with their war clubs and spears, getting their horses rested, singing and dancing and eating some deer that was slain (althought i dont know where the deer came from). When morning came we headed out first thing when the sun came around the horizon, this must have been on the plains obviously for which little trees were in the area and lots of grass reaching to the knees of the horses. When we were crossing that river we rode for what seemed like hours. Then another indian on horseback came to us, he must have been a scout or something. He was in a panic, for which the sioux have spotted him and were getting ready to chase him. The Indian, and i remember this one being significantly different, for which his horse was grey with black spots and he himself had a huge war bonnet with a long lance (or spear). He said we must either go ahead and meet them or coward away. The scout explained that there were more than 50 men who were ready to fight on their side, and just after he finished saying that we heard what sounded like thunder at first, roaring and trembling the earth. We looked and a cloud of dust was approaching and fast. We all got our lances and clubs ready and headed directly at them. I remember in this dream i was extremely nervous, wanting to back out when we were riding towards them. Then this warrior next to me sang some song, probably a war song or goodbye song (songs sung before death). When we finally got into distance i remember seeing one sioux getting knocked off his horse and causing my horse to trip over and eject me off. I was standing their with a club and i seen a sioux charging at me, he has on a white horse with a green painted buckskin or buffalorobe. As he was charging i managed to try and hit him but ended up striking his horse. The horse fell down and the sioux got up, he had the same weapon as me just about, but his had a feather on the handle of the weapon. We circled each other at first before he hit me in the arm, i remember feeling extreme pain as if he broke my arm, then somehow i managed to strike him in the rib, as he fell over i heard loud thundering again, but this time the sky was almost pitch black. As i striked him again, this time clear in the headabove the neck. the thundering got worse and when i turned around all the warriors were dead, including the sioux. I was the last one standing, all except the grey horse with the black spots who had a skeleton on its back.
<br/>
<br/>When i woke up i could feel my arm was bothering me slightly, but that was just one of many dreams i have like that.<br/>

For the first time since this thread was posted, i actually remembered a dream!
<br/>
<br/>part of one anyway...
<br/>
<br/>I was standing in either an alley or a small parking lot shouting at a wall. I was pretending to have an argument with my mother. Although I can&#039;t recall the subject it was most likely some mistake or neglect of hers I suffered in childhood that I still hold a grudge for, despite my relatively normal and healthy chilhood. Acting out arguments past, future and theoritical is actually a pretty normal thing for me to do IRL, but usually in regard to people and subjects in my everyday life (haven&#039;t been to see my family in years and we don&#039;t really keep in touch). Then <i>some guy I&#039;ve never seen before</i> asks me if I&#039;m alright.
<br/>
<br/>I had no idea there was anyone around and then this guy out of nowhere interrupts me having a full-on shouting match with my invisible mother. I was mortified.
<br/>
<br/>I said something like &quot;eh.. uhm.. just talking to myself... i do that...&quot; and shuffled away like an embarrassed zombie.
<br/>
<br/>As usual, my dream was so real i woke up thinking this actually happened. I realized that it didn&#039;t make sense only because it was my mother I was having an imaginary argument with, mostly because I thoroughly exhausted all the real and imaginary arguments we could ever have years ago.<br/>
